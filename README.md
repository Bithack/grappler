# Teorem Grappler

Grappler is an interactive multi-purpose tool for extracting keys and floating point data from key-value databases like LMDB or plain ascii files, and then working with them in a matlab-like interface.

Most basic matrix operations are supported (if you miss anything let us know). We have also support for the external tool bh_tsne which is great for data visualization.

The processed data can be saved in ascii files or bulk written to another database (only Aerospike supported so far).

We use grappler for working with multi-dimensional feature vectors generated with the deep learning framework Caffe.

## Dependencies

Grappler needs the go compiler and toolkit. Go packages are automatically downloaded when the program is built.

In order the use tsne reduction, the binary "bh_tsne" needs to be in the path. Clone it from https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne and compile it.

## Installing, building and running it

    git clone https://github.com/Bithack/grappler.git
    cd grappler
    ./grappler.sh
